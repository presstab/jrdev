      The DEVLOG is a chronological record of changes, investigations, and decisions made during the development process. It serves as a communication tool between LLMs and human developers, providing context and rationale behind code modifications, and creating a valuable historical record of the development journey. CRITICAL: THE DEVLOG MUST BE UPDATED ON EACH OF YOUR OUTPUTS
   </purpose>

   <structure>
      Each entry in the DEVLOG should follow this structure:

      ```markdown
      ---
      ## Investigation/Feature: [Brief Description of the Issue/Task]

      ### USER FEEDBACK:
      - Summarize the user's feedback or request that initiated the investigation.

      ### ANALYSIS:
      - Describe the investigation process, including:
      - The problem identified
      - The root cause analysis
      - The reasoning behind the chosen solution

      ### EDITS:
      1. List the specific file and conceptual code modifications made to address the issue. **No large code snippets**
      2. Include brief explanations of why each change was necessary.

      ```
   </structure>

   <guidelines>
      - Be concise; Keep entries brief and to the point while including all necessary context
      - Be specific; Clearly identify the files and code changes made with accurate file paths
      - Provide context; Explain the reasoning behind the changes to help future developers understand the decision-making process
      - Focus on solutions; Emphasize how problems were solved rather than just describing the problems
      - Maintain continuity; Reference previous DEVLOG entries when building upon earlier work.
   </guidelines>

      ## Investigation: Time Zone Display Issue in Dashboard Component

      ### USER FEEDBACK:
      - User reported: "The dashboard is showing UTC timestamps instead of local time (CET) which is confusing our European team members."
      - User mentioned that this issue appeared after the recent API integration update.

      ### ANALYSIS:
      - Investigated the time handling in the Dashboard component and identified that the TimeDisplay module was not applying the timezone configuration correctly.
      - Root cause: The configuration settings for timezone conversion were being overridden during the initialization sequence in `initializeComponents.ts`.
      - Discovered that the TimeDisplay component was receiving the correct configuration initially, but it was later reset by a secondary initialization call in the rendering pipeline.
      - Considered two solutions:
      1. Modify the rendering pipeline to prevent the secondary initialization
      2. Make the timezone configuration persistent throughout all initialization phases
      - Chose the second approach as it provides more robust protection against similar issues in the future and doesn't require extensive changes to the rendering pipeline.

      ### EDITS:
      1. Updated `src/components/Dashboard/TimeDisplay.ts` to store timezone configuration in a persistent configuration object.
      2. Modified `src/utils/initializeComponents.ts` to check for existing configuration before applying defaults.
      3. Added a verification step in `src/services/timeService.ts` to ensure consistent timezone application across all components.
      4. Added unit tests in `tests/components/TimeDisplay.test.ts` to verify correct timezone handling under various initialization scenarios.
      5. Updated documentation in `README.md` to clarify the timezone configuration process for future developers.
