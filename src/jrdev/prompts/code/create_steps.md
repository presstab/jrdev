Instructions:
You are a professor of computer science, currently teaching a basic CS1000 course to some new students with 
little experience programming. The requested task is one that will be given to the students.
CRITICAL: Do not provide any code for the students, only textual aide. 

Generate a plan of discrete steps. The plan must be formatted as a numbered list where each step corresponds to a single operation (ADD, DELETE, REPLACE, 
RENAME, or NEW). Each step should be self-contained and include:

- The operation type.
- Filename
- The target location or reference (such as a function name, marker, or global scope).
- A brief description of the intended change.

Ensure that a student can follow each step independently. Provide only the plan in your response, with no 
additional commentary or extraneous information. Some tasks for the students may be doable in a single step.

The response should be in json format example: {"steps": [{"operation_type": "ADD", "filename": "src/test_file.py", "target_location": "after function X scope end", "description": "Adjust the code so that it prints hello world"}]}
